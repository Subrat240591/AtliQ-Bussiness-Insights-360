After exploring the data, we now connect and load the AtliQ's data from MySQL database to the Power BI.

Note: Excel/ CSV Files are also the other data source, where the Targets and Market Share data related informations are imported to Power BI.

Data Modelling

Data modeling is the foundation of the report. All visuals are built upon the data model. Poor data modeling can affect the overall performance of the report.

After importing data into the Power BI, the following procedures are to be followed:

Cleaning, formatting and transforming the data using power query

Establishing relationships among the tables, employing either Star Schema or the Snow Flake methodology.

Subsequently, conducting data validation against the benchmarks set by the stakeholders

Task: As a Data Analyst generate insights through reports built considering different sections such as

Finance view Sales view Marketing view Supply Chain Executive View such that stakeholders can unlock insights and enable data driven decision making.
